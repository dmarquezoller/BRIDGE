Description: Provides modular functions for the BRIDGE app, enabling scientists to explore, analyze, and integrate multi-omics datasets (proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and RNA-seq) interactively and privately, without programming skills. Supports individual and integrative analysis, generating interactive visualizations such as heatmaps, volcano plots, and time-course plots. Especially powerful for identifying shared biological signals across omics layers.
