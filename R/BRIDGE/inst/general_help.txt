<h1>Welcome to BRIDGE</h1>
<p>This page provides instructions on how to use the application effectively.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
BRIDGE is an interactive application designed to explore and analyze multi-omics datasets efficiently.
The accepted types of data are Proteomics, Phosphoproteomics and RNA-seq.
It is structured into two main sections: <strong>Individual Exploration</strong> and <strong>Integration</strong>.
Each section offers tailored tools to visualize and interpret your data at different levels.
</p>

<h2>Sections</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Individual Exploration:</strong> This section allows you to explore and analyze omics datasets individually
  (e.g., proteomics, phosphoproteomics and RNA-seq) through a set of different visualizations and tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Integration:</strong> This section focuses on combining multiple omics datasets to reveal shared patterns,
  correlations, and integrative insights across data types, achieving this also with different plots and analyses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Selection</h2>
<p>
Before beginning your analysis, you must import the data. The <strong>Data Selection</strong> panel
serves as the connection to the underlying database. 
Your selections will determine the content available in both the Individual and Integration sections.
</p>

<p>
Once a dataset is selected, relevant visualizations and analysis tools will become available in the corresponding sections.
Make sure your database has been properly generated and contains the required metadata for optimal functionality.
