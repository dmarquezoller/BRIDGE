<h2>Individual Exploration</h2>

<p>
The <strong>Individual Exploration</strong> section allows you to deeply explore the imported datasets individually. 
It provides a suite of interactive and static visualizations to help identify patterns, assess data quality, and extract biologically meaningful insights from your data.

<h3>Available Plots and Analyses</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Raw Heatmap:</strong> 
    Displays the unprocessed expression matrix to allow inspection of the raw signal across samples. 
    This is useful for identifying batch effects or global expression trends prior to normalization.
    There is no further customisation for this plot.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>DEP Heatmap:</strong> 
    Uses differential expressed analysed data to obtain a heatmap. For this plot you can also select if you want <strong>clustering</strong> and how many clusters. 

    Below the plot you can also find a table with the processed values, including p-values or log fold changes.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Volcano Plot:</strong> 
    Visualizes differential expression between selected conditions. 
    Features are plotted by <em>log<sub>2</sub> fold change</em> and <em>-log<sub>10</sub>(p-value)</em>. 
    You can adjust significance thresholds, select which contrast to see and highlight a particular gene.
    Moreover, hovering over the plot shows the gene name each dot represents.
    
    Below the plot you can also find a table containing the data of the significant genes.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Gene Expression:</strong> 
    Shows temporal expression trends for selected genes across timepoints. 
    You can see the expression of one or multiple genes at the same time. The search bar is connected to the database so it shows all available genes.
    You can also choose different kinds of transformations:
    <ul>
        <li>
            For <strong>Proteomics</strong> and <strong>Phosphoproteomics</strong>: Continous, Log-Scale, Total Intensity Transform and Median normalization.
        </li>

        <li>
            For <strong>RNA-seq</strong>: Continous, Log-Scale, TPM, FPKM, TMM and CPM.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Below the plot you can also find a table containing the information of the browsed genes.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Enrichment Analysis:</strong> 
    Performs enrichment analysis on significant data. You can choose both which comparison to enrich and which database to use (GO, KEGG or REACTOME).
    The plot shows the <strong>dot plot</strong> regarding the enrichment analysis.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>PCA (Principal Component Analysis):</strong> 
    Performs a simple PCA (Principal Component Analysis to study the global variance distribution)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Interactive Features</h3>
<p>
No plot is rendered until the user computes it pushing the corresponding button, avoiding rendering time for plots you are not interested in. 
All the plots are interactive and react to the changes of settings.
</p>

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #007bff; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
	All this plots and tables are contained inside one <strong>collapsible tab</strong>. For each dataset you load, an identical but <strong>independent</strong> tab will be generated.
</div>

<p>
This section is designed to facilitate intuitive exploration of single-layer omics data and serves as a foundation before proceeding to integrative analysis.
